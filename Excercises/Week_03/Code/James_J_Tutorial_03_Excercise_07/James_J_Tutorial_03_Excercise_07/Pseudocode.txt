- Prompt user for the current temperature in celsius
- Parse the user input value to make sure it's a correct celsius degree
- IF: Is valid celsius degree
	- Convert the temperature to fahrenheit
- ELSE: Is not valid celsius degree
	- Re-prompt user for celsius value

- Create a const offset for 1.8 as the fractional offset
- Create a const offset for 32 as the whole offset
- Perform the equation (celsius * first offset) + second offset
- Return the value of this equation as fahrenheit
- Print the fahrenheit value to the user
